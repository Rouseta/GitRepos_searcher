# Coding Challenge: create a  GitHub repository searcher  

## Technologies used  
For the App developement I used HTML, CSS, and React. As IDE I have used Visual Studio Code  
## What does the App do?  
This is a easy app to find GutHub´s repositories searching by user name. The App has input field,  and a "Search" button. You just need to type a name in the input field and click on the "Search"button, esay peasy!! The app returns the name, picture and a list of the user´s repositories and you can click on the repos links and you will be redirected to the selected repo in GitHub. The App has also a "Reset" button to clean the data and to start a new search.   
## Future improvements  
I would like to include new functionality to filter by repository name and also an option to mark the repos you like as favorites.  
## Feedback about the task  
At first, reading the task it seemed simple, but calling the data from the api was a bit challenging for me, which I am quite junior and despite the challenge I have learned and enjoyed doing this task very much.
